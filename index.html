<p>My name is Miguel I graduated from Firebuagh High School, where I was part of the class of 2022.
    This is my 2nd year of college, and so far, I've taken three CIS classes. 
    I aim to be able to transfer to UCI when I'm done with Cerritos. While right now I'm not sure what I would do with a 
    computer science degree, I do know I want to major in this field. I like the fact that this field is challenging.
