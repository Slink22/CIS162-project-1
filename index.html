<h2>Intro</h2>

    <p>My name is Miguel I graduated from Firebuagh High School,<br> where I was part of the class of 2022.
        This is my 2nd <br> year of college, and so far, I've taken three CIS classes. 
        I <br> aim to be able to transfer to UCI when I'm done with Cerritos. <br> While right now I'm not sure what I would do with a 
        computer <br>science degree, I do know I want to major in this field. I like the fact that this field is challenging.
